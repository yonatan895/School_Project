    <string name="cover_following"> We\'ll cover the following</string>
    <string name="history_origin">Java was first developed in the 90\’s by James Gosling. It borrows much of its syntax from C and C++ to be more appealing to existing programmers at the time. Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, which was then acquired by Oracle in 2010.
</string>
    <string name="about_java">Java is a statically typed, object-oriented language. <b>Statically typed</b> means every variable and parameter must have a defined type (as opposed to languages like JavaScript, which are dynamically typed). <b>Object-oriented (OO)</b> means that data and functions are grouped into objects, which are usually referred to as methods in OO languages.
    </string>
    <string name="adv_over_c">Java code is compiled to byte-code, which runs on a virtual machine (the <b>Java Virtual Machine</b> or JVM). The virtual machine handles garbage collection and allows Java to be compiled and run on any OS or hardware with a JVM.\n
        \nThis is an advantage over C/C++, which must be compiled directly to machine code and has no automatic garbage collection (the programmer needs to allocate and deallocate memory).
</string>
    <string name="java_packages">The standard implementation of Java comes in two different packages: the <b>JRE</b> (Java Runtime Environment) and the <b>JDK</b> (Java Development Kit). The JRE is strictly for running Java as an end-user, while the JDK is for developing Java code. The JDK comes with the <font color="#FF4081">javac</font> command for compiling Java code to byte-code among other things.
    </string>
    <string name="java_com_proc">To make Java more open and community-based, Sun Microsystems started the Java community process (JCP), which allows a somewhat democratic evolution of Java and JVM specifications.\n
\nAlso, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License in May 2007, resulting in multiple open-source implementations of the JVM. OpenJDK is the current official implementation.
</string>
<string name="eco_ide">The Java ecosystem is huge. It is mainly composed of JVM\’s, libraries, tools, and IDE\’s. The three most popular IDE\’s, in no particular order, are :
</string>
    <string name="eco_lib">Following are some of the most promising new libraries and tools in the Java ecosystem:
</string>
    <string name="lib_list">
        • Maven, Gradle, and other build tools\n
        • Libraries for concurrent programming\n
        • JUnit, Spock, and other test frameworks\n
        • Groovy, Scala, and other JVM languages\n
        • Grails, Play, and other web frameworks\n
        • JVM Cloud providers\n
    </string>
    <string name="eco_jdk">The core class type included in Java is called the JDK. It includes all the basic tools we would need in a modern application, including everything from collection types and queues, to web sockets, to files and image processing. It can be found <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">here</a>.\n
        \nAs an object-oriented language, methods and properties are organized into classes that are organized in packages. Each Java class should be defined in one file named for that class. The classes under <font color="#FF4081">java.lang</font>, such as <font color="#FF4081">String</font>, are always available. Otherwise, we would need to explicitly import the classes using an import statement at the top of our Java file. An instance of a class is called an <b>object</b>. All objects are passed by value. Unlike in C, we cannot modify a reference pointer.
</string>
    <string name="prim_info">A particular aspect of Java is that there are special types called <b>primitives</b>. Unlike objects, primitives do not have methods and always have a value. In other words, they can never be <font color="#FF4081">null</font>.
